NOTES & TO DO

ISSUES TO FIX / CHECK:

  ☐ Check that this error does not recurr - uncaught error (in promise): Cannot read property of 'actionType' of undefined - (see in Evernote) - seemed to be caused by click handler conflicting with mouseover
  ☐ if so, add a try catch
  ☐ maybe I need to return a promise from setTimeout in gazeTimeChoose function?

  ☐ Check animation timings - do disappearing message bubbles fade out quickly enough?

Maybe TODO:

  ☐ Split long inkichatdata into short scenes to be shown on different screens as player navigates the space?
  ☐ If short scenes needed, use routing?

Graphic design IMPROVEMENTS:

  ☐ Font? local
  ☐ custom icons - svg
  ☐ improve colour scheme?
